## wrotu
An addon for Wheat Death of the Universe (WDOTU)

## Building from source
### Untethering the ropes
In order to be able to build the mod, you need to have your own version of the `Wheat Death of the Universe` mod. You can acquire it from WheatenEyes Discord.
### Raising the anchor
Once you have your own copy of the mod, create a `libs` directory in the git root directory. This is the directory where you will place the mod's jar file.
### Setting sail
Now just `cd` into the git root directory, and run `./gradlew build` to build the mod. The output jar will be located in `build/libs`.
